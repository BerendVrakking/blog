Hi

## What is SQL?
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a powerful tool for managing and analysing data. As a programming language designed specifically for managing databases, SQL allows you to extract and manipulate large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. With SQL, you can write complex queries to filter, sort, and aggregate data, allowing them to identify patterns and insights that might not be immediately apparent. Additionally, SQL is used by many businesses and organisations, making it a valuable skill. Overall, SQL is essential for people who want to become proficient in data analysis and management.

## Getting started
Whether you're a business owner trying to make sense of customer data or a student learning about databases for the first time, SQL can help you organize and extract valuable insights from your data. This article will provide an overview of SQL in simple and informal language without technical jargon. We'll start by explaining what SQL is and what it's used for, and then we'll introduce the basic syntax and commands of SQL. Finally, we'll discuss some everyday use cases for SQL and why it's a valuable skill in today's data-driven world.

## Writing SQL "code"
The syntax of SQL is relatively straightforward, and the commands are designed to be easy to read and write. You'll need to learn a few basic commands, such as SELECT, FROM, and WHERE. These commands allow you to select specific columns of data from a table, filter the data based on specific criteria, and combine multiple tables into a single query. With just a few simple commands, you can explore and analyze your data in powerful ways.

``` sql
SELECT column1,column2  ## select the columns that you need
FROM analytics          ## from which data source do you need to get the data 
ORDER BY column1 DESC;  ## order the data by column1 descending
```
